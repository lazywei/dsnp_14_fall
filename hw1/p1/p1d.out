1. First make file with debug mode (-ggdb).

2. In shell: `lldb p1.bug`

3. In lldb: `breakpoint set --line 19`, and then `run`

4. Run line by line until stop. It shows `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` with `code=1`.

5. By searching Google: code=1 means releasing released objects or
accessing un-initialized memory address.

6. Seems like we haven't initialized `*p1` and `*p2`. After adding:

   p1 = new P1a();
   p2 = new P1a();

It should works.
